# Stable Index Vector

This project is to implement a fast version of a container from [a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4xOCvELWlU) I saw.
It's basically 3 vectors working together to be more stable (with regards to IDs) and performant than just one.
I'm not actually using it for anything, it's just fun to build stuff
